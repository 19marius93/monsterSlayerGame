# Monster Slayer Game
This is the Monster Slayer Project that I've made using: HTML, CSS and Vue.js
You can check it out following the link: https://19marius93.github.io/monsterSlayerGame/

Skills used:
HTML: I've used Semantic Elements to make it more comprehensible, I've provided the elements with 'classes' and 'ids' so I can manipulate and style them in CSS, and I've used Custom Events to link it to my .js file.


How it works: 
- everytime you attack, the monster attacks back
- every three round you get a "special attack", which has a slightly higher damage value
- you have a "heal" button, if you feel like the monster is too strong, but everytime you use it, the monster still attacks back
- you have a "surrender" button, which will end the game (with a loss), if you feel like you can't beat the monster
- at the bottom, you have a log console, where all the current moves are stored
